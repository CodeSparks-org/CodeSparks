# CodeSparks

**A platform for collaborative idea sharing and implementation.**

## Build and run

The only prerequisite is .NET 8 installed. Just use typical commands to run the project:
`dotnet build`
`dotnet run`

Or open folder/solution in your favourite IDE and run it.

## Roadmap

* I don't have a specific roadmap for now, but will be happy to implement your ideas in Issues here.
