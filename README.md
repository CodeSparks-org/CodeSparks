## Build, run, contributing
### How to run
The project in this repo is ASP.NET Core app, so the only prerequisite is .NET 8 installed. Just use typical commands to run the project:
`dotnet build`
`dotnet run`
or open folder/solution in your favourite IDE and run it.

### How to run with database
If you would like to have a full dev experience - you also need to configure database.
You need to do 3 simple things to configure database:
1. Create a database in PostgreSQL.
You need to [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for this. It's pretty cool database, which is usually supported fast for new version of EF Core. But you can use any database, in that case - you will need to change migration scripts. So, it may be easier to install Postgres.
   
2. Check the appsettings.json file and change the connection string to match the database that you plan to user and run migrations.
Or, even better - change your [personal secrest.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=windows) file and add there something like:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings:PostgresConnection": "Host=dpg-cq9mcrdds78s739fng50-a.oregon-postgres.render.com;Port=5432;Database=sql_db_s0e5;Username=sql_db_s0e5_user;Password=FObdGBdZ4V9iJZcY7BCEQ6Xj0zJlArBI"
}
```

3. [Apply migrations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/applying?tabs=dotnet-core-cli) with
```markdown
dotnet ef database update
```
