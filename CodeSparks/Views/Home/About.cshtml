        CodeSparks is a collaborative platform for software engineers
        that provides a toolbox with technical ideas together with an environment which helps to grow and turn those ideas into reality.
        This is done through collaboration with people, tools, and AI
        and is designed to empower engineers with their technical journey
        by providing an open and engaging place that helps to grow.

        You can think of CodeSparks as GitHub on steroids or as AI-Powered Development Environment.
